This repo is an example of an HTTP Server using Warp (Rust framework) and a RpcServer using dcl-rpc living in the same process and using the same tcp listener for connections. 

This example was built to test the authentication process for a websocket connection that should be given to the `RpcServer`. This wasn't possible in Actix because their streams are not `Send` and their interfaces to handle websockets don't allow us to build a `WebSocketTransport`, and in tokio-tungstenite because the callback to check headers of a connection donesn't accept a future (for async I/O). Warp uses tokio-tungstenite for websockets but it allows you to give a future on the connection's upgrade event (we are actually not using it in this example) and their interfaces for websockets are compatible with `RpcServer`
